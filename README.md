# Introduction
This is Ising like model simulator which is based on 2D regular lattice environment. Model can be applied as Schelling's segragation model and as well as new product adoption model.

1. Algorithm 0 : Kawasaki dynamic
2. Algorithm 1 : Glauber dynamic (Asyncronous)
3. Algorithm 2 : Glauber dynamic (Syncronous)
4. Algorithm 6 : Glauber dynamic (Aims to reach line by line structure)
5. Algorithm 7 : Glauber dynamic (Aims to reach chessboard structure)
6. Algorithm 9 : Glauber dynamic (Only info infected agents can switch)
7. Else: Voter Model dynamic
