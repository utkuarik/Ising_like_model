# Introduction
This is Ising like model simulator which is based on 2D regular lattice environment.

Algorithm 0 : Kawasaki dynamic
Algorithm 1 : Glauber dynamic (Asyncronous)
Algorithm 2 : Glauber dynamic (Syncronous)
Algorithm 6 : Glauber dynamic (Aims to reach line by line structure)
Algorithm 7 : Glauber dynamic (Aims to reach chessboard structure)
Algorithm 9 : Glauber dynamic (Only info infected agents can switch)
Else: Voter Model dynamic
